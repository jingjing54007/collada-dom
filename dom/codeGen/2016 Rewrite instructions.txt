This is rewritten source code for the Collada-DOM code generator.
It is PHP, as it ever was. This code is intended to be backward-
compatible with most client code, but it is not binary compatible
for dynamic runtime linking purposes. You must recompile binaries
however they are linked. You'll not likely have to modify client
code. 


THIS generator works equally well with the 1.4.1 and 1.5 schema.
And neither is the cleanSchema "script" for preparing the 1.5.xsd
available on the Khronos website required.

The gen.php script takes a single XSD file as its argument. The
tpl-template-engine.php file has many configurable settings. The
code is outputted to ../generated/ by default. The output says so.
Pre-generated files are also provided.


THE old/original generator code was kind of a sprawling nightmare.
The whole thing has been pared down in preparation for developing
the static part of the Collada-DOM codebase. It outputted subopti-
mal files, and contained within it numerous bugs, major and minor.

This archive is a PRISTINE snapshot of the 2016 generator. Future
versions will be incompatible with the pre-2016 static code base.


TO install the new generated files, delete all of the source code
files that beging with the dom- prefix, EXCEPT FOR domAny.h/cpp. 
You'll note that these two files are alongside the static files.

*All of the class specific CPP files are removed and contained by
the single Classes.cpp file. This will greatly impact build times
where there is not a pre-compiled header.

In general the PHP code base is now of much higher quality. It is
not changed in terms of its basic organization; just sanitized.
