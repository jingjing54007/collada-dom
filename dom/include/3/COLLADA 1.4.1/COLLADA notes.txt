The lone COLLADA.h file here is a hint to locate the rest of the schema and copy/paste it into this folder, because its files are no longer part of the versioned history.

There are pregenerated files, and the PHP scripts in the CodeGen/ folder can be used to generate headers for the schemas, not limited to COLLADA.
