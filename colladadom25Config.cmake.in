#Note: There used to be a lot here. Going by what contemporary 
#projects are doing, the above should suffice. I'm uncertain as
#to what all it defines, but there is a big problem with there
#not being standard definitions, so it seems best to not define
#anything if at all possible. 
#The colladadom25Targets file seems to originate from inside of
#dom/CMakeLists.txt. (The EXPORT bit.) And it should be noted 
#that colladadom3d is not covered at all. Should it be included?
#If so, how??
